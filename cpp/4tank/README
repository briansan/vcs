Description: a simulation of the coupled 4 tank system
- here is an ASCII-art representation of the system

   |---------------vv 
   |    vv---------------|
   | |------|   |------| |   vv = spouts where water can fall
   | |  tl  |   |  tr  | |   oo = an adjustable valve [0.0, 1.0]
   | | tank |   | tank | |   <==> = a pump that ejects water at 
   | |  (1) |   |  (3) | |          a certain velocity

Definitions:
- tank:
  - defined by its radius and height
  - holds information about its drain hole (radius/height/valve)

- pump:
  - defined by its pipe radius, velocity, and valve ratio
  - valve ratio defines the percentage of water that will be
    diverted into the upper tanks 

- coupled :
  - water from the left pump flows into bl and tr tanks
  - water from the right pump flows into br and tl tanks


Getting Started:
- currently this simulation only runs under the OMNeT++
  runtime
- you will need to install OMNeT++ and set up your 
  PATH variable appropriately
- then you should invoke:
  opp_makemake -I../include -L../lib -lTank -f
  make
  ./omnet
- since a mechanism for sending messages during runtime has 
  not yet been realized, all the command messages must be
  define at compile-time.
  - edit the initialize() method in omnet/OMNeTTankMaster.cc
    with the messages you would like to send to the tank system
    and when you would want to send the message
    - the methods you should use are:
    setTopLeftTankValve(),    setTopRightTankValve(),
    setBottomLeftTankValve(), setBottomRightTankValve(),
    setLeftPumpValveRatio(),  setRightPumpValveRatio(),
    setLeftPumpVelocity(),    setRightPumpVelocity()
      - first arg: value, second arg: time
